# Markdown IDE Release Notes

## 0.7.0

- Added support for VS Codeâ€™s **Find All References**: quickly see every
  document linking to the one you're working in.
- The **extract-note-with-title**, **extract-note-with-content**, and
  **link-to-note** refactors are now always available, regardless of whether
  Tikibase mode is enabled.
- File deletes, renames, and title updates now run as proper refactors: link
  updates happen in the background and are flushed to disk automatically.
- Cleaned up redundant command palette actions that are now covered by regular
  refactoring.
